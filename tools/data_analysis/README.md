## Data Analysis
This folder contains scripts to analyse the data captured during the experiments.

`comparison.ipynb` is the main analysis.
`exclusion_criteria_analysis.ipynb` analyses what would have happened if the exclusion criteria had been different.
`imi_baseline_unit_contrast` & `imi_baseline_unit_contrast` demo our attempts at prediciting imi-scores.
