## Data Generation
This folder contains scripts to generate the stimuli. 
The shell-scripts to generate each experiment (pilot, actual experiment) are stored in their respective folders.

1. `create_task_structure_json.py` creates a json file that fully characterizes each task. 
2. `create_task_structure_from_json.py` digests this json file and copies the required stimuli to the desired location.
3. The appropriate instructions are copied into the target folder.
